::: danger The self-hosting documentation has not been completed.
:::

We are working on new documentation and a simplified deployment process for users that wish to self-host.

In the meantime, we have published a [blog post](https://blog.omnivore.app/p/deploying-a-minimal-self-hosted-omnivore) which may help you get started.

If you are interested in contributing to the self hosting effort, please join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/h2z5rppzz9).
